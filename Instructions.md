# NYC Squirrel Census Visualization Project

<img src="./assets/squirrels.jpg" width="500" height="500">

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create an interactive web application using React to visualize and analyze the data from the New York City Squirrel Census. Your application will retrieve data from the provided API and possibly other data sources to present insights through visualizations, comparisons, and interactive elements.

## Real-World Relevance

This project mirrors the types of tasks that developers often encounter in the workplace. In many roles, developers are required to:

- **Integrate with APIs**: Many applications depend on external data sources and services. Learning to integrate and work with APIs, as you will with the NYC Squirrel Census API, is a fundamental skill for developers.

- **Create Interactive User Interfaces**: The ability to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces is crucial. This project demands that you not only fetch and display data but also create a user experience that allows for interaction and exploration, which is key in customer-facing applications.

- **Data Storytelling**: One of the most powerful aspects of data visualization is its ability to tell a story. Through this project, you will learn how to present data in a way that narrates the habits and patterns of NYC squirrels, providing insights that can be understood at a glance. Effective data storytelling can influence decision-making and drive action in business settings, making it an invaluable skill for developers who work with data-intensive applications.

- **Visualize Data**: The demand for data visualization is growing across industries as businesses seek to gain insights from data and communicate these insights effectively. Developing skills in building tools that can graphically represent data helps in making information more accessible and actionable.

- **Work in Teams**: Collaboration is a cornerstone of modern software development. Working in teams on this project will help you learn how to divide tasks, integrate code, and blend different ideas and approaches effectively.

- **Problem Solving and Innovation**: This project challenges you to go beyond simply displaying data, pushing you to think about how best to analyze and present it to end-users in an engaging manner. This kind of problem-solving and innovative thinking is highly valued in development roles.

By completing this project, you not only learn technical skills but also gain experience in how these skills are applied in a professional context to solve real-world problems and add value to a business or organization.

## Objectives

- **Use React**: You will use React and any other npm packages and/or frameworks you wish in order to create your application. There are no requirements on which technologies you use.
- **Use CSS**: Make your project visually appealing through Vanilla CSS or any CSS Framework you wish to use
- **Fetch Data**: Your application must consume the NYC Squirrel Census API and can optionally use other APIs or data from the web.
- **Data Manipulation**: Include calculations to make comparisons and derive insights from the data.
- **Data Storytelling**: Craft narratives around the data. Showcase how data can be used to tell stories and convey insights effectively through your visualizations.
- **Data Visualization**: Present the data in an engaging and interactive way. You can use dashboards, tables, charts, heatmaps, or even creative text displays like word art.
- **Beyond Display**: _\*\* Do not merely fetch and display data;_ add value by processing, filtering, and summarizing before presenting it.

## Requirements

- **API Usage**: Must use the [NYC Squirrel Census API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data). (optional to use any other supplemental APIs)
- **Interactivity**: Your app should allow user interaction to explore different aspects of the data.
- **Presentation**: Show us your app and tell us the story of your chosen data.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:
   - Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub profile.
   - After forking, go to your GitHub profile, find the forked repository, and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Explore the API**: Familiarize yourself with the [NYC Squirrel Census API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data). Understand the data fields and response format.
3. **Plan Your Application**:
   - **Decide on the type of visualization and comparison metrics**:
     - **Example Comparison**: Compare the frequency of squirrel activities such as foraging and eating across different parks in NYC. Calculate and visualize the percentage of squirrels engaged in these activities within each park to identify which park has the most active squirrel population.
     - Consider how to display this information. You might use a dahboard or bar chart to represent each park with bars colored differently for each activity. Alternatively, a pie chart for each park could show the proportion of each activity. Or your narrative could be displayed in a completely different way than charts and graphs. Be creative. Use the [Inspiration](#inspiration) section for ideas.
     - **Interactive Components Requirement**: You are required to create at least one interactive component, that represents your data narrative. You can choose to build this as one comprehensive component or as several smaller, interconnected components, each displaying different facets of the data.
   - **Identify any additional APIs or datasets you might want to integrate**:
     - You might find it helpful to integrate additional data you retrieve elsewhere either through other APIs or from retrieving subject info through another website.
4. **Development**:
   - Set up API calls to fetch the data.
   - Implement the UI components.
   - Add interactivity and data processing logic.
5. **Testing**: Ensure your app works and has no major bugs.
